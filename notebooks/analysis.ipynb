    "This workbook provides a way to analyze the .pickle results from inverse design and negative selection. It also provides a plotting tool for $\\phi$ field .npy files. The methods available in the Analysis class stored in src/analysis.py are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) plotTrajectory - plots the trajectory of free energy taken during the inverse design and negative selection, as well as the cell parameters during inverse design and a zoom in of the difference in alternate structure free energies to the target during negative selection\n",
    "2) plotSequence - plots the sequence function and interaction matrix at (a) the initial guess (b) after inverse design (c) after negative selection\n",
    "3) plotBlockChi - ONLY for the 'multiblock' sequence representation. Returns a plot of the block fraction and interblock $\\chi N$ values\n",
    "4) plotEnergy - plots the difference in free energy between the target and alternate structures.\n",
    "5) plotStructures - plots the structure either as a volume, surface, or sliced at a specific plane.\n",
    "6) movieStructures - does the same as plot except generates a .gif for the inverse design step\n",
    "7) movieSequence - generates a .gif movie of the sequence during inverse design or negative selection\n",
    "8) determineEqm - for a pickle file, re-evaluate the final refined solutions after negative selection to determine if the target is the equilibrium among considered alternates\n",
    "9) plotPhi - for just plotting a $\\phi$ .npy field. Must provide the full filepath to where the field is stored."
