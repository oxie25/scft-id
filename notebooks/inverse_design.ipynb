    "### Inverse Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse design and negative selection are demonstrated here for the $O^{70}$ diblock network phase. The user only needs to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Load in the space group structural files associated with the space groups that form the target and alternate candidate structures.\n",
    "2) Load a target file. One for the $O^{70}$ structure in the paper is provided. All target structures should be contained in the 'converged_structures' directory. This target must be an integrated $\\phi$ field\n",
    "3) Run inverse design and negative selection using the hyperparameters in the paper. Note: For the $O^{70}$ structure in the paper, the tolerance in free energy difference before stopping is hit is set at 1.0001 (0.01%), here in the default 'run_all' method, 'ns_offset' is set at 1.0005 (0.05%). This may result in convergence to a different sequence than reported in the main text, or even no convergence at all in negative selection, since the relative difference in free energies for the diblock $O^{70}$ phase is very small. Change 'ns_offset' to 1.0001 to use the parameters reported in the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "The class InverseDesign is contained in src/inverse_design.py and contains the necessary methods. An easy-to-use method called 'run_all' is provided replicating the hyperparameters used in the paper. Additional methods and options can be found in the .py file.\n"
