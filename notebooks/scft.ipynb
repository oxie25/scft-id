    "### SCFT\n",
    "\n",
    "SCFT is performed with the loss function approach. The user only needs to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Load in the space group structural files associated with the space groups for which we are interested in finding self-consistent solutions.\n",
    "2) Specify a copolymer sequence (using one of the several provided representations). Here, a diblock sequence of $f_A = 0.38$ and $\\chi N = 17.5$ is given as an example.\n",
    "3) Run SCFT using a method which reproduces the hyperparameters used in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class SCFT is contained in src/scft.py and contains the necessary methods. An easy-to-use method called 'run_scft' is provided replicating the hyperparameters used in the paper. Additional methods and options can be found in the .py file.\n"
